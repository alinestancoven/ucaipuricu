Confidential personal and financial information can be a valuable asset for criminals – these can be used to steal identities, money, data, and more.

After a long layoff where I kept getting dumber and dumber, I have decided to start reading again.

I have updated the filters and everything else but I cannot get the ads to stop showing up.
